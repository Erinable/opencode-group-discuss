# Add Theme System with Color Blindness Support

## Overview

Implement a configurable color theme system that supports multiple color schemes including high-contrast and color-blind-friendly palettes

## Rationale

The current TUI uses hardcoded colors (cyan, magenta, red, green) which may be inaccessible to users with color vision deficiencies (especially red/green color blindness). A theme system would improve accessibility and allow personalization.
